Implemented Sliding banners using Owl carousel.

Fetched data dynamically and rendered on UI.

On adding the product to cart incremented the cart count, and if same product is added more than once just incremented the particular product count.

On clicking on cart you will be redirected to checkout page where you will see details of all the products added in cart including their respective quantity.

"Place order" button resets the cart count value to zero and redirects to Thank you page, Here we have added a button if the client wants to make a new order accordingly he is redirected to home page..
